Machine Learning image classification can be used in almost every field. Great candidates are whatever it takes a human a long time to know what the image is and any repetitive process. Some uses include detecting cancer cells, discovering new exoplanets, detecting errors in wafer manufacturing, the self-driving car, verifying signatures, detecting fruit disease, discovering new archeological sites, detecting crime, face recognition, etc.

In this project, we are going to identify breeds of dogs using CNN and the Stanford dogbreed dataset.
To achieve this, we will develop a model using CNN and Densenet21.
